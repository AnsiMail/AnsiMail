# Variables information file

# Each option has been described in as much detail as possible
# READ EVERYTHING VERY CLOSELY

#####-------- REQUIRED SECTION

# This is the domain name for which the mail server will be set up.
# This should not contain any subdomains, only the main one
# NOTE: This is going to be the primary domain for which we are going
#       to set up NSD, certificate management, subdomain management
#       If you have additional domains for which you want to handle 
#       mails, set them up later in the appropriate section
domain: <change-me> # e.g. aisha.cc

# The hostname is one which is what the ip here is hosting
# the one which is going to act as the subdomain, if the hostname here
# is put to mail, then the ip here is going to be directed via 
# mail.domain.tld
# It is generally a good idea to call this something like mail, mail1
# or something similar, to make it clear to the outside world that this
# is an actualy server which was set up with mail in mind
# NOTE: the reverse dns lookup should also resolve to whatever
#       you input over here: hostname.domain.tld
#       e.g. my hostname is called mail and the reverse dns resolves to
#       mail.aisha.cc
hostname: mail # can change it if you so prefer, but this is a nice one

# ipv4/ipv6 address of this server
# We need to get this manually instead of automatically in the case
# that this server is behind a NAT and is only reachable via forwarded ports
# TODO: currently the configuration is not configurable if you don't have an
#       ipv6, but it should be done very soon. Given that most hosting providers
#       give an ipv6 you shouldn't be worried about it too much.
ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 1.2.3.4
ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. dead:beef

# This is the user that will be created and all server information emails
# daily reports and outside domain reports will be send to admin@domain.tld
# This is not an actualy system user, but an email only user 
# NOTE: AnsiMail is configured so that you can actually use this account
#       as your daily email, by filterting all emails that are domain related
#       to go into a information-archive email folder. This is very easy to set up
#       using mail filtering. I will add a small section on how to configure mail
#       filtering in the appropriate section, so don't worry about that right now.
admin: <change-me> # e.g. aisha

# Secondary nameservers are those which are our `slaves` because these 
# nameservers are the ones to which we will be sending NOTIFY and AXFR
# NOTE: These are NOT the same as the ip's of the nameservers of the 
#       DNS hosting provider, such as ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com. These are
#       given to you when you configure the DNS provider as a secondary 
#       service, not when using as the primary 
# TODO: For some reason only ipv4 ones work correctly, even though you can
#       add ipv6 names here (maybe I should read some more)
# order doesn't matter
secondary_nameservers:
        - ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 69.65.50.192 # freedns2 (afraid.org)
        - ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. 2a00:1768:1001:9::31:1 # some cloudns server
        - ipv4: <change-me> # add as many as you want... :)

# These nameservers are used by others in the internet to find your servers
# through DNS querying.
# They are the ones that should resolve to ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com/ns1.<dns-provider.tld>
# or something of that form, which makes it clear that they are DNS servers
# Each bullet point is one nameserver with at most one ipv4 and one ipv6
# You can have a nameserver with an ipv4 and no ipv6 (also the other way around, 
# but don't use any nameserver of this kind)
public_nameservers:
        - ipv4: <change-me>
          ipv6: <change-me>
        - ipv4: <change-me>


#####-------- OPTIONAL SECTION

# Almost each option here is independant of others and it is fine to even delete the 
# option and not even define it. AnsiMail has checks to see if the option is defined
# and only then takes any steps.

# SSH
# It is most likely the case that you are installing this on a headless VPS with 
# only ssh access in which case it is very advisable to change the port of ssh
# to something other than the default 22, unless you like getting hackers constantly bombarding
# your port to check out what you messed up
#ssh_port: 2345

# In addition to the ssh port if you want to open some extra TCP/UDP ports
# you can define them here and 
#additional_tcp_ports:
#     - <change-me>
#     - <change-me>
#additional_tcp_ports:
#     - <change-me>
#     - <change-me>

# Private interface
# By default AnsiMail hardens your firewall to only allow the needed ports to communicate
# with the internet and blocks all other ports from being accessed by others. This is a
# safety check in case of vulnerabilities in any of the ported softwares.
# If you have any interface that you want to open fully you can define it here.
#private_interface: <change-me>  # on the off chance that this doesn't cover you use cases
                                 # you should probably roll out your own firewall config
                                 # as it is impossible for a small automated script as AnsiMail 
                                 # to set up the cute beautiful beast that is pf

# Complex: This section is bit more intricate and can be skipped
# It may be that you have some extra subdomains not hosted on this machine or 
# other nsd configuration, e.g. google-site-verification txt records or something
# else that should be added to the default nsd config file. Any such configurations
# can de added to a file and AnsiMail will dump the contents at the end of the default
# config.
# NOTE: Some subdomains are currently automatically configured to point to the current machine
#       so make sure that those are not redefined in your addon file.
# restricted subdomains: www, <hostname>, imap, smtp, pop3, autoconfig, 
#                        autodiscover, wkd, mta-sts
# HINT: first run do the install without the addon and see what is generated
#       if you want to see if your addon is compatible (it most likely is)
#nsd_addon: <change-me>
