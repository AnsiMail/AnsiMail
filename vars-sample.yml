# Each option has been described in as much detail as possible.
# READ EVERYTHING VERY CLOSELY.

#####-------- REQUIRED SECTION

# This are the domains for which the mail server will be set up.
# NOTE: You can have as many domains as you want in this list
#       for each domain you can decide to enable/disable NSD separately.
#       It is strongly advised to enable NSD as it does a lot
#       of certificate management, subdomain management and record
#       management for authentication.
#       Seconday DNS overview - https://excision.bsd.ac/guides/secondary/
#       If you don't enable nsd for a domain, it is on you
#       to ensure that all records are properly managed -
#       https://excision.bsd.ac/guides/manualdns/
domains: 
  - name: <change-me> # e.g. bsd.ac
    nsd: True         # HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, else remove or set to False
                      # depends on enable_nsd: True (see OPTIONAL SECTION below)
  #- name: domain2.tld
  #  nsd: False
  #- name: domain3.tld3
  #  nsd: True

# The hostname is what the ip here is going to be called.
# If the hostname here
# is put to mail, then the ip here is going to be directed via 
# mail.domain.tld
# It is generally a good idea to call this something like mail, mail1, vmail
# or something similar, to make it clear to the outside world that this
# is an actual server which was set up with mail in mind.
# NOTE: the reverse dns lookup should also resolve to whatever
#       you input over here: hostname.domain.tld
#       e.g. for bsd.ac, the hostname is called mail.bsd.ac and the
#       reverse dns also resolves to mail.bsd.ac
hostname: "{{ mail_subdomain }}.{{ domains[0].name }}" # can change it if you so prefer, but this is a nice one

# This is the user that will be created and all server information emails
# daily reports and outside domain reports will be send to admin@domain.tld
# This is not an actualy system user, but an email only user: admin@domain.tld
# NOTE: Excision Mail is configured so that you can actually use this account
#       as your daily email, by filterting all emails that are domain related
#       to go into a information-archive email folder. This is very easy to set up
#       using mail filtering - 
admin: <change-me> # e.g. aisha

# public ipv4/ipv6 address of this server 
# We need to get this manually instead of automatically in the case
# that this server is behind a NAT and is only reachable via forwarded ports
ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 1.2.3.4
ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. dead:beef

#####-------- OPTIONAL SECTION

# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS SECTION
#
# If you want to make Excision Mail manage nsd on your behalf you should say yes here
# It is really recommended to do this as configurin NSD manually is really really
# hard given the horrible web interfaces used by service providers
# In the worst case where you want to do it yourself, you can visit the wiki page 
# and the NSD role for documentation. It is highly detailed and explains every step 
# of the way. 
# Be aware that configuring it yourself is going to take upwards of 7-8 hours, 
# unless you are experienced with DNS setup
#enable_nsd: False # set to True to enable (disabled by default)
#
# NOTE: These are NOT the same as the ip's of the nameservers of the 
#       DNS hosting provider, such as ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com. These are
#       given to you when you configure the DNS provider as a secondary 
#       service, not when using as the primary 
#secondary_nameservers:
#  - ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 69.65.50.192 # freedns2 (afraid.org)
#  - ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. 2a00:1768:1001:9::31:1 # some cloudns server
#  - ipv4: <change-me> # add as many as you want... :)
#        
# These nameservers are used by others on the web to find your servers
# through DNS querying.
# They are the ones that should resolve to pns31.cloudns.net/ns42.<dns-provider.tld>
# or something of that form, which makes it clear that they are DNS servers.
# Each bullet point is one nameserver with at most one ipv4 and one ipv6
# You can have a nameserver with an ipv4 and no ipv6 (also the other way around)
#public_nameservers:
#  - name: pns31.cloudns.net
#    ipv4: 185.136.96.66
#    ipv6: 2a06:fb00:1::1:66
#  - name: <change-me>
#    ipv4: <change-me>
#    ipv6: <change-me>
#  - ipv4: <change-me>
