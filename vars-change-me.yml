# Each option has been described in as much detail as possible
# READ EVERYTHING VERY CLOSELY


#------------ REQUIRED

# This is the domain name for which the mail server will be set up.
# You need at least one domain name.
# Additional domain names will be allowed in the optional configurations.
domain: <change-me>

# This is the network interface talking to the outside world
# through which you will be receiving emails and clients will be connecting.
#interface: vio0 # this is the one generally used on Vultr and other VPS platform
interface: <change-me>

# ipv4/ipv6 address of this server
# We need to get this manually instead of automatically in the case
# that this server is behind a NAT and is only reachable via forwarded ports
ip: <change-me>
ip6: <change-me>


# This is the user that will be added to :wheel and also quite a bit of other 
# config is done to allow this user to work the system
# (and if you use ssh_harden, will also be allowed ssh access to server)
# Make sure that this user does not exist prior to running
# Ansimail creates a default _ansimail user that is used to do configurations
username: <change-me> 



#------------ OPTIONAL

#--- NSD config (if you want to run a stealth master configuration)
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ENABLE
# (this is going to be a bit long)
nsd_enable: true

# These nameservers are the ones to which we will be sending NOTIFY and AXFR
# BEWARE: these are not the same as the ip's of the nameservers of the 
#         DNS hosting provider, such as ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com. These have are
#         given to you when you configure the DNS provider as a secondary 
#         service, not when using as the primary 
# For some reason these are currently only ipv4 (maybe I should read some more)
secondary_nameservers:
        - <change-me>
        - <change-me>

# These nameservers are used by others in the internet to find your servers
# through DNS querying.
# They are the ones that should resolve to ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com/ns1.<dns-provider.tld>
# or something of that form, which makes it clear that they are DNS servers
# You will also need to provide these for any additional domains that
# you add in the following section
public_nameservers:
        - <change-me>
        - <change-me>
public_nameservers_ipv6:
        - <change-me>
        - <change-me>

# Additional domain names for which to configure the mail server
# Each of them is going to allow users to send the emails as if sent from 
# their domain name
# If you are enabling multiple domain names, it is a good idea to read
# up on the NSD config (not necessary)
# Also you need to provide secondary_nameservers and public_nameserver(_ipv6)
# for each of the additional domains seperately
#
# COMPLEX ENHANCEMENT: allow 
additional_domains_present: false
additional_domains:
        - <change-me> # domain-1 # e.g. epsilonknot.xyz
        - <change-me> # domain-2

        - 


# SSH by default uses password authentication
# We can harden ssh by only allowing certain users to 
# access the server using ONLY public-key based authentication
# Enabling this option adds a tonne of options, some of which are
#  - SSHFP records to NSD (which also enables DNSSEC)
#  - disables password bsaed logins for everyone
#  - enables pubkey access for specified users (the username value from above
#      is added by default, no need to list it here again)
#  - changes default port of sshd to specified value
ssh_harden: false
ssh_port: 2244 # or <change-me>
